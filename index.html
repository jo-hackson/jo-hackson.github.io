  	<h1> <i>Bem vindo a Lisboa</i></h1>

  	<p>Lisboa is the capital of Portugal, a small little country that is most often overlooked by its bigger neighbor, Spain</p>

  	<h2>Some highlights of Lisboa</h2>

  	<p> There are many things to do in Lisboa. The best way to enjoy any city is to stay for a month to get a feel of the pace, lifestyle and culture. However, if you're crunched on time, then I would recommend some of the following highlights:

	<h3>Touristic Sights</h3>

	<p>

		<table class="image">
			<caption align="bottom">Mosteiro dos Jer&oacute;nimos (Jer&oacute;nimos Monastery)</caption>
			<tr><td><img src="mosteiro.jpg" width = 400></td></tr>
		</table>

		<p> Although you need to take some means of public transportation to <b>Mosteiro dos Jer&oacute;nimos</b> as it is in Bel&eacute;m, it is worth the trip to see this great example of Late Gothic style of architecture.
		</p>

		<table class="image">
			<caption align="bottom">Convento do Carmo (Carmo Convent)</caption>
			<tr><td><img src="carmo.jpg" width = 316></td></tr>
		</table>

		<p> Situated in the city center, <b>Carmo Convent</b> is a great example is how the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake, or<i>tri-disaster</i>: earthquake, tsunami, and fire, devasted the city and is one of the deadliest earthquakes in history.

	<h3>Beaches</h3>

		<p> There is a magical train, although not as magical as the Hogwarts train, that will take you from Lisboa to Cascais. If you pick a seat facing the water, you will have an mostly unobstructed view of Atlantic Ocean that is gorgeous. Each stop along the way has beaches for you to enjoy.
